Design in Autodesk Eagle CAD, by me, Andrew Barney, December 2021. **Prototype not yet tested.**

This design is a heavily modified derivitave based on the **"Stick Amp"** by Marcelo Privé, designed and shared sometime between 2002 and 2004. Marcelo Privé's amp was an improved version of Chris Crain's Chapman **"Stick® Player’s Headphone Amplifier"**, which was built and shared online sometime before 2003. Both designs center around the LM386 Low Voltage Audio Power Amplifier.

The LM386 is one of the most common amps used in DIY guitar preamplifiers due to its ability to run on a single 9V battery. The well-known "Smokey Amp" uses an LM386 and is notable for being able to fit in a cigarette package. The "Ruby" amp is a modified version of a Little Gem amplifier.

In contrast, this prototype design is designed around the more modern LM4819 and TPA321. The design should be compatible with any of the following chips that have the same basic pinout for the SOIC package. Possible Chips include: LM4819, TPA751, TPA321, TPA741, TPA721, TPA711, TPA701, TPA301. By using a more modern chip like the LM4819 or the TPA*** family means that it can run on between 2.5 VDC – 5.5 VDC. This means we can run it on a 3.7/4.2V Lipo battery instead of a large 9V battery.
